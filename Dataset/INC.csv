@INCIndia it's not like that India people are not liking Congress.... We as Indian don't like that any one is going to foreign tour and saying wrong things regarding internal politicians and politics. Bcz they are the internal part of India.

"Historically if we see Indian Politics , @INCIndia was not weakened by @BJP4India . In early 80âs lot of regional parties ate away congress votes using caste consolidation. Congress moved towards coalition. 

@BJP4India just ramped it up with hindutva and nationalism"
@Shivani_Real Pathans were involved in Indian politics since   11th century. Hindustan was always a 2nd home to the Pathans.
"@SupriyaShrinate @RahulGandhi Like @BJP4India cannot be absolved from Muslim genocide in 2002, similarly @INCIndia cannot be absolved from 1984 Sikh genocide! Personally I like your articulation And fighting spirit! But both these parties are the âPancham Varnaâ in Indian politics for me!"

Sad to see Nitesh position in today politics . Till 2014 he was respected but since 2016 his way of working and popularity has declined.  He is no more relevant in Indian politics.  He is no jaiprakash.
"@Mannu5_ The reason politics is full of corruption, gundaaraaj, business affluent, HNIs because they know the pulse of Indian electoral psychology! Paisa, power and misguided pomp n show and we know where the herd will walk! Since 2013 the wave has been âHindus are in Dangerâ 3/n"
"@Mannu5_ True May be! But no political party including congress has done anything to uplift the people of India! Weâre always stuck in region, religion, language, the basis of any election and thatâs the core problem, we vote wrong we vote emotionally and not sensibly 1/n #IndianPolitics"

@amitmalviya What is the evidence of what the Indian troops did in Tawang? The government refuses to give official statement and details of injuries. What Rahul Gandhi said is right. Indian soldiers did get injured and the government is busy managing politics around this.
"#RahulGandhi RG should grow up. Comments like ""Indian troops being thrashed by Chinese"" are comments of college politics, not national politics. It was in bad taste."
"@KirenRijiju @KirenRijiju @RahulGandhi @INCIndia @BJP4India I donât think anyone or any party is insulting the Indian Armed forces, so dont drag them into your politics! Chinese aggression is well documented, imminent issue so stop these petty sniping &amp; have a mature discussion on policy"

@javedhassan itâs nice how he selectively failed to mention Indian army doesnât interfere in politics and Indians have enjoyed greater freedoms than Pakistanis including the freedom to criticize army leadership. I think more and more people are convinced Bajwa was one of the main problems.

"@TOIPlus @chetan_bhagat Nobody asked for your opinion. Do you have any proof to substantiate your claim of M Kharge having the Gandhi family support? 
You continue to cheerlead the fascists. 
Why is @TOIIndiaNews publishing this bs? Who wants to read Chetan's opinion on Indian politics?"
@jagwindrpatial @INCIndia @BJP4India @ArvindKejriwal @Akali_Dal_ @BhagwantMann @DGPPunjabPolice Nice to hear that's thanks to the @AamAadmiParty who is bring revelations in indian politics
"Can Congress PCC members repat 1939 when Netaji defeated Pattavi Sitaramya, so called official candidate of Gandhiji and elect Sashi Tharoor as Congress President. Congress could be relevant in Indian politics if and only if they can remove the shackles of a family."

This is one way of mobilising people against evil. Whether they will succeed or not, only time will tell."
@ShashiTharoor @INCIndia @ShashiTharoor is the candidate we need to revive our Indian politics- this election is even more critical than the 2024 election! #thinktomorrowthinktharoor in @ShashiTharoor with trust @INCIndia @RahulGandhi @SoniaGandhi_FC
@subhajit_n And most probably you are sponsored by them. BJP wants to bring North Indian politics of caste and wants to divide Bengalis so that one fights another and hate each other since they canât win here.
"@ShashiTharoor @INCIndia @ShashiTharoor is the last hope for possibility of #Congress revival. If Dr. #Tharoor looses #congresspresidentpoll then Congress might loose opposition space &amp; other parties might take that space in Indian #Politics

"Truly @RahulGandhi is incompatible for Indian politics. Do you know why? He can't play and talk like Modi Babu. He still hasn't been able to fed the people of India with bullet of religion. He speaks straight and straight.

@SylviaPye @LetsStopC9 Actually who does take the biscuit...Modi or Hitler ð¤ Indian politics plays a part in our society unfortunately and since Brexit we looking for trade deals whatever the cost ð¢ usually to human lives and freedom. Fascism is a real danger to us here. We can't stay blindfolded.

"@ANI The ""all inclusive""train has left the station long back.Appeasement was the engine with the Gandhi family guiding it for decades. Polarisation is the new fait accompli of Indian politics. Reached a point of no return. It's an academic assessment.Not mine."
"@ipsvijrk Chapati sounds Female

"@RahulGandhi What few agents of everything did.
Commission agents destroyed job offering plans.
No one is ready to listen.

They are collectively selling India."
