@ashoswai How much Modi ideology contributed to this? I am an African and I grew up watching Indian movies which made me love India without meeting an Indian ever. But the recent politics of India has forced me change my attitude. I wish the love feeling I had for India endured.
@sardesairajdeep This precisely is why BJP/RSS are totally silent on this momentous occasion of 75th death anniversary of Bapu. They cannot make communal amity an article of faith to live by. Communal venom is oxygen to their politics. They want to have Godse on the lips and in the heart too.

@Memeghnad I developed interest in politics and elections in 2011 during the IAC movement. Been against BJPs politics since then. 11 years now and Indian politics is still mediocre with no improvement in sight. There are better things to worry about.
Sudhanshu Trivedi is the best spokesperson of BJP in the present time. I have very rarely seen him losing his patience in a debate. The one thing I really like about him is his knowledge. He always argues with facts and has a great knowledge of history and Indian politics.

"@Matt_Schrader_ @PramitWorld A foolâs errand not for pinning the entire blame on India or its domestic politics, but on thinking that religion plays any role in this.

@dpradhanbjp @narendramodi @PMOIndia @poojakapilmisra some Indian politician are so busy on doing politics over cloth and religion that they literally ignore what is important ...in india these same minister compare national level exam with school unit test what's next that left
Bjp cannot win election 2024 as it has lost its relevance in Indian politics after settlement of  land dispute of temple .Today it is surviving due to the disunity in opposition but  people's have learned a lot and will vote the winner against bjp on its own in each area .
